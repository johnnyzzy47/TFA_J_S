Please note that Jieru had some tech issue with accessing her Google VM, so she had to do her job on Zhaoyu's VM to complete her part, that's why most of the commits were done by Zhaoyu. We actully followed the guideline to split the job by similar amount and Jieru had notified TA and Prof. about her issue with VM through Piazza and email. Please do not deduct the commitment score, thank you.
